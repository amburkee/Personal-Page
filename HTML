				I am an Interactive Graphic and Design student. I am taking this class because when I took Intro to Web,
				I really enjoyed it. I want to see if this might be something I want to go into for my career, and I want to 
				improve my coding skills along the way. My favorite class that I've taken so far is Experimental Design. 
				In that class I really got to let my creative side flow with my more logic side. I was able to program some 
				really cool things that could light up and make noises. I'm not to sure where I want to go or who I want to work for, but
				I do have a few areas that interest me. Those areas are animals (shelters/rescue), medical (Ears - hearing loss), or
				something with children (special ed, Big Brother/Big Sister, etc.). *Fun fact: I have moderate hearing loss in my right ear!*
				I have a lot of animals! I have three leopard geckos (Janet, Michelangelo, and Aria), a crested gecko (Draco), a bearded dragon (Mister), a guinea pig (Charlie), and two cats (Ash and Morgan). (If you want pictures I will proudly give you pictures!) My hobbies include taking care of my animals, curling up with a thick blanket while watching YouTube, and eating
				blueberry bagels with vanilla yogurt (tastes so good). I'm a homebody but I do love to get out and travel different places, if I can. I've traveled outside the state to Greece, Turkey, Italy, Canada, and a few other places. Oh, and as for classes I am taking this semester, besides this one, I am taking Design for Social Equity, Hitler and Nazism, and Portfolio.
